## âœ… Fixes Implemented (Assessment Challenge)

### Problem 1: Frontend Developer Challenge  
- **Location**: `/app/notices/add`  
- **Issue**: When clicking the **'Save'** button, the **`description`** field was not being saved.  

#### ðŸ”§ How I Fixed It:
1. Checked the **form state** and found that the `description` field was not properly bound.  
2. Updated the form to use **React state + React Hook Form** so the description field value is captured.  
3. Fixed the **onChange handler** for the description input to correctly update state.  
4. Ensured the field is included in the **payload** when making the API request.  
5. Tested by creating a new notice and verified that the description is stored successfully in the backend.  

- **Status**: âœ… Fixed & Verified
